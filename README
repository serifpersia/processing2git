I needed a way to update my app from processing, acessing github REST API to get latest release version like v1.0 etc.
It will get latest release tag, compare with the file you already have(the file checked has to have v1.0 or something 
otherwise the check will fail.
The zip name set as fileName is the file the code is looking for in the latest release tag.
After downloading the zip gets extracted, the old file with outdated version in its name gets deleted.
Code creates download progress bar as cue that the process is running
